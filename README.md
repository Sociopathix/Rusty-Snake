I tried to upload an Unix executable, but it was too big for GitHub (that's what she said).

Do keep in mind that you will need to install Rust and Cargo, and then you can use Cargo to install Bevy. Bevy is the top game engine for Rust using an ECS framework. It's really neat!

Once you have everything installed, you can use the `cargo run` command in a console in order to build and run the project. I tried to only provide the base files you need to build the
project, but haven't tested it on Windows (if anyone wants to test it on Linux for me <3) yet, so I may have left out something that's needed. If you need help installing Rust, or can't
get the project to build, here are some resources I used:
* [Rust Installation Guide](https://rust-lang.org/learn/get-started/)
* [Bevy Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction/)
* [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html)
* [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
* [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)
* [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro)
* [List of Key Codes](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/prelude/enum.KeyCode.html)

Good luck! If you have any issues after install, feel free to message me on Discord! c:
